"""Module containing functions to remove external signal from geomagnetic data.

Part of the MagPySV package for geomagnetic data analysis. This module provides
various functions to denoise geomagnetic data by performing principal component
analysis and identifying and removing outliers. Also contains an outlier
detection function based on median absolute deviation from the median (MAD).

    """Remove external signal from SV data using Principal Component Analysis.

    Perform principal component analysis (PCA) on secular variation
    residuals (the difference between the observed SV and that predicted by a
    geomagnetic field model) calculated from annual differences of monthly
    means at several observatories. Uses the imputer from sklearn.preprocessing
    to fill in missing data points and calculates the singular values of the
    data matrix for n observatories (uses Singular Values Decomposition, SVD).
    The residuals are rotated into the eigendirections and denoised using the
    method detailed in Wardinski & Holme (2011). The SV residuals of the noisy
    component for all observatories combined are used as a proxy for the
    unmodelled external signal. The denoised data are then rotated back into
    geographic coordinates. The pca algorithm outputs the singular values
    (these are equal to the square root of the eigenvalues of the covariance
    matrix) sorted from largest to smallest, so the corresponding eigenvector
    matrix has the 'noisy' direction in the first column and the 'clean'
    direction in the final column.

    Note that the SVD algorithm cannot be used if any data are missing, which
    is why imputation is needed with this method. The function
    denoise.eigenvalue_analysis permits missing values and does not
    infill them - that is the more robust function.

    Smallest eigenvalue: 'quiet' direction

    Largest eiegenvalue: 'noisy' direction

    Args:
        dates (datetime.datetime): dates of the time series measurements.
        obs_data (pandas.DataFrame): dataframe containing columns for
            monthly/annual means of the X, Y and Z components of the secular
            variation at the observatories of interest.
        model_data (pandas.DataFrame): dataframe containing columns for field
            model prediction of the X, Y and Z components of the secular
            variation at the same observatories as in obs_data.
        residuals (pandas.DataFrame): dataframe containing the SV residuals
            (difference between the observed data and model prediction).
        proxy_number (int): the number of 'noisy' directions used to create
            the proxy for the external signal removal. Default value is 1 (only
            the residual in the direction of the largest eigenvalue is used).
            Using n directions means that proxy is the sum of the SV residuals
            in the n noisiest eigendirections.

            column and columns for the denoised X, Y and Z secular variation
            components at each of the observatories for which data were
            provided.

            external magnetic field in the denoising stage.

            the singular values of the obs_data matrix.
        - eig_vectors (*array*):
            the eigenvectors associated with the n largest
            singular values of the data matrix. For example, if the residuals
            in the two 'noisiest' directions are used as the proxy for external
            signal, then these two eigenvectors are returned.

            SV residuals rotated into the eigendirections.
